# HR Analytics Project

# Project Problem Statement

Employee absenteeism can significantly impact business operations and productivity. Understanding patterns in employee leave, particularly sick leave, can help organizations take proactive measures to improve workplace health and operational efficiency.Seasonal illnesses, localized epidemics, and even external events like major sports matches can contribute to variations in attendance. 

This project aims to analyze employee leave trends to identify potential health risks, seasonal absenteeism patterns, and external influences affecting attendance. By leveraging data analytics, organizations can implement preventive health measures and optimize workforce planning.

# Objectives

- Analyze employee leave patterns to identify trends in sick leave and general absenteeism.
- Detect abnormal spikes in sick leave that could indicate health concerns such as seasonal flu outbreaks or localized epidemics.
- Correlate absenteeism trends with external events like major sports matches or public holidays.
- Provide insights to HR teams to plan proactive health initiatives (e.g., flu shots, workplace sanitization measures).
- Improve workforce management by predicting high absenteeism periods and optimizing staffing plans.
- Enhance employee engagement by addressing attendance-related concerns effectively.

# Data Sources

The dataset used in this project includes:

- Employee attendance records with leave types (sick leave, casual leave, work-from-home, etc.).

# Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and data visualization.
- **Excel/CSV** as data sources.
- **DAX** for advanced calculations and trend analysis.

# Project Outline

## 1. Data Collection & Preparation
- Gather raw data from HR systems, health records, and external event databases.
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, format date columns, etc.).

## 2. Data Modeling
- Design an optimized data model using relationships and star schema principles.
- Create calculated columns and measures using DAX.

## 3. Dashboard Development
- Build interactive visualizations for absenteeism trends, peak sick leave periods, and correlations with external factors.
- Use slicers and filters to enhance user interaction.
- Develop a user-friendly layout with insights and summaries.

## 4. Insights & Analysis
- Identify patterns in sick leave and general absenteeism across different time periods.
- Detect abnormal spikes in leave patterns that may indicate health concerns.
- Correlate absenteeism trends with major events (e.g., flu season, sports matches).
- Provide actionable recommendations for HR teams to improve workplace health and staffing efficiency.

## 5. Deployment & Sharing
- Publish the report to Power BI Service.
- Configure access settings and embed reports if necessary.
- Document project methodology and findings in a README file.

# Conclusion & Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we will provide recommendations on mitigating absenteeism through proactive health measures, optimizing staffing strategies, and improving employee engagement.
